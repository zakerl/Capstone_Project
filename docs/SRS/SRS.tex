\section{Introduction}

Researchers at the School of Rehabilitation Sciences (SReS) at McMaster University are investigating treatment strategies for victims of spinal disorders and back pain. Currently, there is great interest in performing Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of those who suffer from back pain and disorders in order to make treatment options more effective. EMA aims to study the thoughts, experiences, and behaviours of a patient's daily life by repeatedly collecting data in an individual's normal environment, at or close to the time they carry out that behaviour.\\

Specifically, the type of EMA that the SReS is interested in is focused on analyzing the daily activities and symptoms of mostly-older adults with mobility and spinal issues. For example, they may be interested in performing EMA on a patient with spinal compression issues which prevent them from being able to walk long distances without experiencing pain or distress. They wish to track that patient's walking activity as they go about their daily life. If this patient stops walking or moving, they wish to prompt them with questions such as, "Did you stop moving? If so, was it due to pain? Describe your pain, describe which portion of the body it is in." The answers to these questions will be combined with activity monitoring data to form a better picture about the experience this patient has with their spinal and mobility issues.\\

In order to accomplish this, the researchers have attempted to use various smart-watch-esque activity tracking devices to track the activity of their patients, and have attempted to use apps and different pieces of software for them to prompt their patients with questions. However, they have been frustrated with very limited success, and are looking for a system which integrated precise and relevant activity tracking with user-friendly self-reporting symptom functionality.\\

The researchers require a method to perform EMA analysis in a manner which even older patients can use, integrated into one package which gathers relevant data about a patient's activities and allows them to easily report what is currently going on and how they feel. They also are looking for a way to access EMA data in various ways. This includes graphical representations of the data which are meaningful to researchers, along with the raw data itself. This data could be activity data, symptoms reporting data, both types of data collated together, and so on. \\


This introductory section of the document is intended to provide a reader with an overview of the purpose, overall scope, and organization of the document. As well as a description of the characteristics of the intended reader of this document.\\

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

This document is intended to describe the requirements of Team \#1's system in a structured and collected manner. In other words, this is a document focused on what the system needs to do and the metrics and methods used to measure its performance. This groundwork is laid in a way to allow every individual who reads this document to understand the details essential to the requirements of this system.\\

Additional purposes of this document are to plan for the design stage of the project, foster effective communication between members of the team, and to establish reference material to which team members will be able to refer back to at later stages in the project should they need to acquire a higher-level view of the system.

\subsection{Changes from template}
This document was written based off of the sample work provided in the 4T06 course gitlab page, and changes have been made from the template accordingly. They are included here:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Added a constants subheading to section 1. This project does not use the mathematical notation included in the template.
	\item Added a section for users and stakeholders.
	\item Added subsections for monitored and controlled variables.
	\item Renamed Solution Characteristics Specifications to Assumptions, as most of the original Solution Characteristics Specifications is not relevant to this project, other than the 					assumptions section.
	\item Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.7 are not applicable to this project and have been labelled N/A.
	\item The Development Plan and Value of Auxiliary Constants sections are not applicable to this project and have been labelled N/A.
	\item Added a section for Project Attributes, Normal Operation Overview, Undesirabled Event Handling, and FSM and Dataflow Diagram, and Legal and Regulatory Factors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope of Requirements}

The scope requirements for a system which satisfies the goals of EMA must be defined properly. In the case of this project, the requirements must include a method of activity monitoring and a way to prompt users with questions relevant to EMA. In addition, this system will be used by older adults in Canada, specifically in a typical Canadian household environment, likely with a fixed daily routine. This system is not intended to be used by bedridden or sedentary users. If a user is unable to maintain a certain level of movement on a regular basis, the entire point of EMA is rendered moot. It is also necessary to exclude children from the sphere of users. This system must be designed for adults, aimed specifically towards older adults.\\

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

While this document is intended to describe the requirements of the system in as abstract of a method as possible, it is unreasonable to expect a layman without any knowledge within the field of mechatronics to understand the contents of this document. Therefore, there are certain characteristics that a reader must have in order to fully grasp the scope of this SRS. \\

A reader should have a grasp of software development, electronics, mechanics and dynamics at a level equivalent to a 3rd-Year Mechatronics Undergraduate University student, as well as a basic understanding of human anatomy of which a high school level is adequate. \\

In addition, a reader should have a high-level understanding of Ecological Momentary Assessment. This does not have to be particularly in depth, but a reader should be able to identify the main objectives, practices, and difficulties of performing EMA. Introductory resources related to this can be found here [specify where]. \\

\subsection{Organization of Document}
This document is organized in a way to make it simple for a reader to understand the essentials regarding the requirements of the system. Should one be interested in gaining a general understanding, it is highly recommended to read this document in its entirety. However, should one wish to learn about specific aspects of this project, please feel free to navigate to any individual section as they are each individually comprehensible. If the reader of this document is a participant in the SReS EMA program, the information relevant is located in sections 2, 3, and 4. If the reader of this document is a researcher performing EMA, the information relevant is located in sections 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, and 13.\\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Dr. Luciana Macedo of School of Rehabilitation Science at McMaster University (Project Supervisor).
		\item  Dr. Spencer Smith (Project Supervisor).
	\end{itemize}

\item Users: The design has 2 different users:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Researchers}: Primary end user who will use the data collected by the device for analysis and research.

	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristi	cs and lists the system constraints.  \\\\
\subsection{System Context}

This system in theory is very simple. An array of sensors grabs info regarding the position, speed, orientation, etc. and uses that information to understand the current state of the user. This data is then used to generate prompts that the user will answer and all the collected data is compiled, processed and stored within the system. Finally, researchers will analyze the collected data and generate observations. 
\begin{figure}[h!]

 \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{System Context Diagram}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}

\item Patient Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Patients are required to set up the device correctly so that their various attributes (Orientation, velocity, etc.) can be collected.
\item Patients are also required to answer the prompts given to them so that adequate data can be collected.
\end{itemize}
\item Researcher Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Required to confirm that data is being collected.
\item Required to set up the intial thresholds and activities for tracking.
\item Offshoot the data.
\item Charge and calibrate the system.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

Patients should have a general understanding of using smart devices with touch screen interfaces. Patients will also be required to wear the device on their body so a good understanding of how to setup the device and secure it will be required. Finally the device will prompt users to answer certain prompts, thus knowledge of what to expect and how to respond is required.\\

Researchers will have the option of tweaking the configuration of the device, allowing them to manipulate certain activity thresholds. Thus a working knowledge of the system is required. Moreover, a basic understanding of graphs and statistical analysis will be required to understand the research data collected by the device.\\\\


\subsection{System Constraints}

The design will consist of both a hardware and a software system. The constraints for both systems are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hardware}: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The system must weigh less than 100g to facilitate being lightweight and comfortable.
		\item The system must have an average battery life of atleast 7 days to facilitate monitoring of the users.
		\item The dimensions of the system must be quite small with an area lower than 2500mm\textsuperscript{2}.\\
	\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Software} :
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The system will have hard time constrainsts so as to store data and prompt users with low latency .
		\item To maintain privacy, the system will only store data for two weeks after which the data will be deleted.
		\item The system must prompt users based on activities and not based on time of day. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Specific System Description}
\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

Dr. Luciana Macedo investigates treatment strategies for older adults with musculo-skeletal disorders, based on the results reported through Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA).
The current solution is not very sensitive to slow and subtle movements. It also works on a time-based approach, reporting data after specified intervals. Moreover, the Human Computer Interface is not user-friendly for the targeted audience and the data gathered is difficult to analyze.
The motive is to design a device that is able to capture very minor movements, that could produce data of interest based on the survey results along with a well-designed interface following HCI conventions allowing users to navigate with ease.

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

  \item PID controller: This stands for proportional–integral–derivative controller. It is an instrument used in industrial control applications to regulate temperature, flow, pressure, speed and other process variables.
  \item FSM: This stands for Finite State Machine. An FSM is a machine that can be in a specific state from finite set of states based on previous conditions and inputs.
  \item OLED display: It stands for organic light-emitting diodes screen. This is the display screen where light is produced by organic molecules.
  \item MVC: Model-View-Controller. It is a software architectural pattern used to implement user interfaces, data and controlling logic. It separates display from program logic.
  \item Control variables: These are the variables that will be controlled in our implementation and research to avoid their impact.
  \item Monitored variables: These are the variables that will be calculated based on program logic and output as a result.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparison to existing solutions}
Most of the solutions are just softwares when installed, uses phone sensor data to cause an intervention. They are very dependent on mobile phone sensors, meaning if there are no sensors on the phone, the software application becomes obsolete.
The app might also have to be open 24/7 or running in background to be able to read live sensor data.  Some of the current solutions involved a time-based EMA trigger
which may cause the data collected to be segregated as the trigger time intervals could be well beyond when the user expressed a desired behaviour.
\\\\
Most of the solutions could include smartwatches such as Fitbit, Samsung Galaxy Watch. These products are not very accurate as they could track movement wrongly, leading to wrong results.
These devices can also be easily tampered by participants, which could affect the results produced in favour of participants. The battery life on these devices are also very short, and they can drain rapidly with very little use.
They also tend to be very expensive due to some features offered, which may not be useful to the situation.
\\\\
The device that we will be designing will be independent of the cellphone devices. This removes the ambiguity in the linking of phone sensors to software application for tracking. It will be collecting data live and triggering EMA based on sensor data, thus being momentary and
more accurate responses are expected to be responded at the time of happening. It will also thrive to use very sensitive sensors, so that every minor movement can be captured, which is limited to the existing solutions due to their dependency on phone sensors.
Some of the softwares could be very expensive despite the limitations they have, such as being dependent entirely on phone. This makes the overall system expensive as the user will need
to be owning a phone which could add to the total expenses. The device that we will be designing is also expected to have longer battery life and ease-of-comfort while wearing. They will have an added layer of security, where the participants cannot recalibrate the devices, hence enhancing accuracy of the results.
It will be very cheap and specific to the purpose, thus ensuring better performance, and higher reliability.
\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}



\begin{itemize}

  \item[PS1:] The display screen will be around 2500 mm$^2$. This will be the interface between the user and the system.
  \item[PS2:] The bracket around the screen will be approximately 2700 mm$^2$. This will be an added layer of protection against the screen to avoid damages to the screen itself.
  \item[PS3:] The weight of the device will be around 100 grams. This is because of the additional weight coming from the straps and embedded sensors. The resultant force will be in the direction of arm, since arm weighs approximately 3.5 kg, making the device lightweight.
  \item[PS4:] The strap will be approximately 75mm long on the short side and 140 mm long on the long side, so that it sits perfectly and comfortably on the user's wrist.

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Goal Statements}
\begin{itemize}

  \item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] \textbf{Minor movement tracking}: The idea is to be able to capture very subtle, minor movements, as most activity trackers are incapable of doing it. Since our target audience have limited movements, the device needs to be sensitive to capturing minor motion since that would produce the desired data.
  \item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] \textbf{Event-based prompting}: Based on desired trigger events, the user would be prompted to complete the EMA.
  \item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] \textbf{Simple User Interface}: We want to be able to design a very intuitive User interface, one that would be very interactive and easy to navigate around. This would result in quicker and more accurate survey submissions as they are prompted.
  \item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] \textbf{Graph Representation}: Researchers desire to be able to capture the trends in the behaviours over a set time. Graphical outputs are the best method to capture and understand the behaviour of certain dependent variables.

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy:} The accuracy of the data collected during each EMA session by this device must meet the level needed for academic research based on said results. This includes results from sensors capturing participant activity, answers provided by participants from event prompting, timestamps of data inputs, geolocation information, and any other information pertinent to the form of EMA being performed.\\

\underline{Rationale:} Should the EMA data coming from the system be considered inaccurate or incomplete, this system is effectively rendered moot as it is intended to be used in a research setting.\\

\underline{Fit Criterion:} The data recorded, stored, and submitted by the system should be accurate to a level considered satisfactory to standard EMA studies conducted by the SReS.\\


\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability:} This system should useable by any individual participant who falls within the categeries defined within the user characteristics section of this document. In addition, this system should be easy to set up, monitor, maintain, and reconfigure by any researcher performing EMA using the device.\\


\underline{Rationale:} As many of the participants may be older adults, they may be unfamiliar with modern activity tracking technology. It is unreasoneable to expect such participants to be able to use the functions of this system unless it is explicitly designed to be useable at any level of experience with technology. Also, we don't wanna waste the time of the researchers or introduce unneccessary complexity into operating this system which may introduce erroneous inputs or data interpretations based on confusing interfaces.\\


\underline{Fit Criterion:} The system's interfaces (both to the researchers and the participants) should fit the guidelines of HCI standards, with an emphasis on making this system more useable for those unfamiliar with modern technology.\\

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability:} Once completed, the system should be entirely maintenance free for the time period it is used for EMA (7 to 14 days). The participants should not have perform any maintenance actions at all during this period, and the researchers at most should have to recharge the batteries of the system and update the parameters they set for the next set of EMA.\\

\underline{Rationale:} As many of the participants may be older adults, maintenance of this system may be daunting to those unfamilar with modern technology. In addition, any downtime due to maintenance needs during each EMA period will result in a loss of valuable EMA data.\\

\underline{Fit Criterion:} Once activated, the system should perform all of its functions continuously without error for a period of 7 days.\\

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability:} The system must be capable of performing its functions of data collection and prompting in any location or situation a participant may find themselves in (within their daily activities). In addition, the system must be constructed in a manner which allows the participant to wear/carry, move, and use the device easily and without hassle.\\

\underline{Rationale:} Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is meant to be performed at almost all points of a participant's daily routine. If the system is bulky, difficult to maneuver around or wear, or heavy, a participant's movement and actions will be hindered and they will be unable to provide EMA data accurately.\\


\underline{Fit Criterion:} Has been tested in each individual environment where EMA will be taking place with satisfactory results regarding its portability.\\


\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Cleanabiity}:]
  \textbf{Cleanability:} Each portion of this device must be capable of being cleaned, sanitized, and made hygenic before and after each period of EMA which it is used for. As each component of the device is constructed and used in a different manner, the different needs each component has in order to render it clean must be considered as well.\\


\underline{Rationale:} In a post-COVID world, maintaining personal hygiene is rightfully considered an important aspect of daily life. It is the responsibility of this devices makers to ensure conditions or practices conducive to maintaining health and preventing disease, especially through cleanliness.\\

\underline{Fit Criterion:} Can be sterilized, cleaned, or treated safely and in a manner satisfactory to the standards of the participants and researchers of the SReS.\\


\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Safety}:]
  \textbf{Safety:} The system must be designed in a way which prevents any harm or injury (whether it be physical, emotional, or mental) from coming to the participants as a result of the useage of the device and its information collection methods. This includes physical characteristics which prevent immediate injury (removal of sharp objects, useage of soft materials), physical characteristics which prevent long-term adverse health effects (human-safe materials, safe levels of noise production), or any other considerations that need to be taken in order to prevent harm to the participant.\\


\underline{Rationale:} Safety speaks for itself. To put a participant in harms way as a result of the functions of this system would be a gross violation of ethics.\\

\underline{Fit Criterion:} The system conforms to the health and safety standards deemed appropriate by the SReS.\\

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Reusability}:]
  \textbf{Reusability:} The system must be capable of being reused for an appropriate number of times. This means that the system must be capable of completing its functions without error after each period of EMA without need for significant upkeep other than regular maintenance (charging the battery, cleaning the device, scrubbing data from the system, etc.)\\

\underline{Rationale:} Researchers at the SReS intend to use this system for a vast number of EMA periods, and for multiple different forms of research which EMA may assist with. Thi system must be designed to be able to sustain its functions for whatever purposes and periods of time which the researchers need.\\

\underline{Fit Criterion:} Can be used for 3 consecutive EMA study periods without need for significant maintenance.\\

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Privacy}:]
  \textbf{Privacy:} This system must protect the data collected from the participants from being accessed or distributed to inappropriate entities or people. \\


\underline{Rationale:} Data privacy is a right, and one that must be taken seriously. When revealed to inappropriate people or entities, personal information can be used to negatively affect a participant to a great extent. Preservation of the security of participant's peronal information is therefore essential.\\

\underline{Fit Criterion:} Data is collected, distributed, and then erased from the system according to modern data privacy standards.\\

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accessibility}:]
  \textbf{Accessibility:} This device must be accessible to any participant who is partaking in EMA. Regardless of disability, mental or physical status, a participant must be capable of utilizing this device for EMA with the full ability to collect and respond to prompts in accordance with EMA principles. This includes designing the system's phyical portion with accessibility needs in mind, along with designing the system's software, user interface, and data collection portions to allow any participant to be able to use it.\\

\underline{Rationale:} If this device is exclusionary to those with special accessibility needs, then it is severly limited in its use for EMA. According to the user characteristics, this device will mostly be used for those suffering from musculo-skeletal disorders, and many of these participants may be suffering from additional disabilities as well.\\

\underline{Fit Criterion:} The system has been verified to perform in accordance to modern accessibility standards, for both the physical component of the system, and the data collection/software component of the system.\\

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_NonDisruptiveness}:]
  \textbf{Non-Disruptiveness:} The system must be designed in a way which allows participants to provide EMA data without significant impact or change to their activities or daily life. This includes bulky constructions which they must spend effort in considering while moving around, significant visual or auditory disruptions which may startle, distract, or annoy participants, embarassing or aesthetically unpleasant constructs, or any other disturbances that they must make considerations for.\\

\underline{Rationale:} It is of paramount importance that this device does not disrupt the daily activities of participants in order to preserve their dignity, and allow them to perform the necessary tasks of their daily lives. In addition, the less the system disrupts their daily activities, the more accurate the picture will be that the system captures of what those daily acitivities are and their relevance to EMA.\\

\underline{Fit Criterion:} The system must be rated sufficiently non-disruptive to the daily lives of the participants using the system during testing.\\

\end{itemize}


\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well. In other words it shows the dependencies 
between different requriements and assumptions in the document.

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed.

\section{Project Attributes}
This is a comphrehensive list of the various Open Issues, Costs and Risks involved with the project. This will be updated to reflect changes in the Design. Moreover this section also includes some stretch goals that may be accomplised depending on the pace and scale of the project.
\begin{itemize}
\item Open Issues:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A decision must be made whether the design will be worn on the wrist like a smart watch or on the waist like a belt.
		\item Sensor choices must be decided for optimal state detection of the user.
		\item Data transfer protocol must be decided, (Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wifi etc.)

\section{Normal Operation Overview}
\setlength{\parindent}{20pt}
Initially, the researcher will connect to the device using the provided software and either register a new participant or select a pre existing participant profile. Once a participant is selected, the researcher can set the thresholds, activities to be tracked and the monitoring period. \\

Once the device is handed off to the participant, an inital set up process is done, where the device is worn by the user and a test prompt is sent. Once this initial set up process is done, the user will simply carry on with their normal day to day and the device will track all registered activities using the onboard sensors. As the data is collected, it is logged into the internal memory and is stored based on the date and time of entry.\\

Finally after the monitoring period is finished, the device will go into an idle state until it is returned to the researcher. The researcher will then log in using their master credentials at which point the device will off load all data into the host software which will compile and present the data in a graphical manner.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Undersired Event Handling}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Incorrect start up prompt response}: When the device is turned on by the user for the first time. A simple start up prompt is given just to check that system booted correctly ("Is this device on?"). If the user incorrectly enters their responsem, the system will simply 				perform a quick restart and ask the same question again.

	\item \textbf{Stagnant sensor data}: Should the device store the same sequence of data for an extended period of time, the system will perform a soft reboot of the sensor array to try to fix the issue. If the problem persists, An alert will be sent out to the researchers informing them 			of a system failure.

	\item \textbf{Improper prompt request}: Should the device generate a prompt whe no activity is being conducted. The user can simply report the prompt and the sytem will record an error, perform a soft reboot and continue normal operation.

	\item \textbf{Early battery failure}: The device's battery should normally last one week. If the charge goes below a predefined threshold before the monitoring period ends, activity tracking will cease and the user will be prompted to charge the device.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
        successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
        to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
        application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
        computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
        or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
        least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
        question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
        mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
        member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
