This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
  ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
  something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item{\textbf{DT\_1: Regular Inputs}\\}\label{DT1}
		
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device waits for the monitoring period to be set up in the configuration of the device.
							
		Input: Monitoring Period ["Date","Time"]  : ["03-11-2022", "05:30:PM"].
		
		Output: Device turns off after Monitoring Period.
							
		How test will be performed: The test is performed by passing in the Monitoring Period and ensuring that the device maintains power throughout this period.
					
	\item{\textbf{DT\_2: Invalid Inputs}\\}\label{DT2}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device waits for the monitoring period to be set up in the configuration of the device.
							
		Input: Monitoring Period ["Date","Time"] : ["3rd November 2022", "Five Thirty PM"].
							
		Output: Device returns an error code to the Error Handler and asserts the Invalid Data Error (BED\_ERR\_INVALID\_DATA).

\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Device should track Minor Movements}
The following tests are run to ensure that the device is able to track activities to a resolution deemed sufficient for general activity tracking. Tests will involve varying the rate at which the device is moved,rotated oriented etc. and checking if the status of the Sensors is valid.

\paragraph{Minor Tracking Test}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{MTT\_1: Regular Movement} \\}\label{MTT1}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is worn with all systems working.
							
		Input: Wearer performs activities at a regular/normal pace.
		
		Output: Status returned by the Sensor Array is no error (BED\_ERR\_NONE).

		How test will be performed: The test is performed by strapping the device onto a test volunteer who will perform the tracked activities at a normal/regular pace. This is done to ensure that the device can 				work under normal scenarios.\\


	\item{\textbf{MTT\_2: Slow Movement} \\}\label{MTT2}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is worn with all systems working.
							
		Input: Wearer performs activities at a very slow pace.
		
		Output: Status returned by the Sensor Array is no error (BED\_ERR\_NONE).
		
		How test will be performed: The test is performed by strapping the device onto a test volunteer who will perform the tracked activities at a very slow pace. This is done to ensure that the device can 					work under scenarios in which users have limited mobility.\\


\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Device prompts user when activity is detected}

The following tests will be done to ensure that the proper info is prompted to the user when activities are detected. Tests involve generating the test prompt, generating prompts for different activities.
		
\paragraph{Prompt Tests}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{PT\_1: Test Prompt} \\}\label{PT1}
	
		Control: Manual

		Test Prompt: Is this Device on?\\
		Possible Answers: Yes or No
		
	\item{\textbf{PT\_2: Activity Prompt} \\}\label{PT2}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is in the idle state.
							
		Input: Activity has been detected.
		
		Output: Specific activity prompt is displayed.
							
		How test will be performed: The test is done by having a test volunteer perform one of the activities that are registered. This should result in a prompt for the volunteer that is generated based on the 					specific activity performed.\\\\
		Tracked Activity: Participant slows down or comes to a stop.\\
		Activity Prompt: Are you in pain?\\
		Possible Answers: Yes or No
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Customizable Thresholds}

The following tests will be done to ensure that the proper info is prompted to the user when activities are detected. Tests involve generating the test prompt, generating prompts for different activities.
		
\paragraph{Threshold Tests}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{TT\_1: Regular Inputs} \\}\label{TT1}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is in Configuration mode.
							
		Input: Regular values for thresholds within limits.
		
		Output: Config File generated successfully.
		
		How test will be performed: The test is performed by setting the device to configuration mode and then setting valid values for the thresholds.\\
		eg: \\
		Speed Threshold:\\
		Limits: 0m/s \textless Threshold \textless 5m/s

	\item{\textbf{TT\_2: Below lower limit} \\}\label{TT2}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is in Configuration mode.
							
		Input: Values for thresholds below lower limits.
		
		Output: Config File generates a BED\_ERR\_OUT\_OF\_BOUNDS.

		How test will be performed: The test is performed by setting the device to configuration mode and then setting values for the thresholds above allowable limits.

	\item{\textbf{TT\_3: Above Upper limit }\\}\label{TT3}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is in Configuration mode.
							
		Input: Values for thresholds above upper limits.
		
		Output: Config File generates a BED\_ERR\_OUT\_OF\_BOUNDS.
		
		How test will be performed: The test is performed by setting the device to configuration mode and then setting values for the thresholds below allowable limits.

	\item{\textbf{TT\_4: Invalid Value} \\}\label{TT4}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is in Configuration mode.
							
		Input: Invalid values for thresholds.
		
		Output: Config File generates a BED\_ERR\_INVALID\_DATA.
		
		How test will be performed: The test is performed by setting the device to configuration mode and then setting invalid values for the thresholds.

	\item{\textbf{TT\_5: No Value} \\}\label{TT5}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is in Configuration mode.
							
		Input: No values for thresholds.
		
		Output: Config File generates a BED\_ERR\_INVALID\_DATA.

		How test will be performed: The test is performed by setting the device to configuration mode and then setting no values for the thresholds.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Data Storage}

The following tests will be done to ensure that data is stored when appropriate. Tests include checking when storage buffer is full, when prompts are generated and when sensor data needs to be logged. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{DST\_1: Storage Buffer Full} \\}\label{DST1}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is in an idle state.
							
		Input: Activity detected causing prompt to be generated (Internal storage is full).
		
		Output: Data Storage system generates a BED\_ERR\_MEMORY\_FULL
		
		How test will be performed: The test is performed by first loading the internal memory buffer with garbage values so that it is nearly/completely full. Then a registered activity is triggered generating a 					prompt. Once this is answered, the system will not have enough memory to store the new values thus resulting in an error.

	\item{\textbf{DST\_2: Prompt Generated} \\}\label{DST2}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is in an idle state.
							
		Input: Activity detected causing prompt to be generated.
		
		Output: Prompt Response is saved into the internal memory.
		
		How test will be performed: The test is performed by performing a registered activity and ensuring that the prompt generated is answered and its result is stored in the internal storage buffer.\\
		eg: Registered Activity: Participant slows down or comes to a stop for an extended period of time\\
		Prompt Generated: \\
		Are you in pain?\\
		Possible Answers: Yes or No\\
		\\
		Prompt Generated: \\
		Do you need assistance?\\
		Possible Answers: Yes or No\\

	\item{\textbf{DST\_3: Sensor Storage} \\}\label{DST3}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is in an idle state.
							
		Input: Activity detected causing prompt to be generated.
		
		Output: Specific sensor values that triggered a prompt are stored in the internal memory.
							
		How test will be performed: The test is performed by performing a registered activity and ensuring that the sensor values that caused the prompt are stored in the internal storage buffer.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Data Extraction}

The following tests will be done to ensure that can be extracted and presented in a graphical manner deemed acceptable for the purpose of EMA analysis.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{DXT\_1: Extracting Data} \\}\label{DXT1}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is connected to the device manager.
							
		Input: Command that tells the device manager to extract all data from the internal memory.
		
		Output: Extracted data is sent to the Host Software where it is converted to a presentable form.

		How test will be performed: The test is performed by first running the device as intended and waiting for a small monitoring period to finish. After this the device is connected to the Host Software with the 				help of the Device Manager Driver. Once connected, the user can start the extraction process and should be able to see all the relevant data in a presentable manner.
		
	\item{\textbf{DXT\_2: Extracting No Data} \\}\label{DXT2}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is connected to the device manager.
							
		Input: Command that tells the device manager to extract all data from the internal memory.
		
		Output: Device Manager returns a BED\_ERR\_EMPTY\_DATA error

		How test will be performed: The test is performed by first deleting all the contents of the internal memory prior to connection with the Host Software. Once connected and the extraction process begins, the 				system should return an error due to no data being present to extract.

	\item{\textbf{DXT\_3: Extracting Corrupted Data} \\}\label{DXT3}
	
		Control: Manual 
							
		Initial State: Device is connected to the device manager.
							
		Input: Command that tells the device manager to extract all data from the internal memory.
		
		Output: Device Manager returns a BED\_ERR\_INVALID\_DATA error

		How test will be performed: The test is performed by first deleting all the contents of the internal memory and filling it with garbage values prior to connection with the Host Software. Once connected and 				the extraction process begins, the system should return an error due to corrupted data being present to extract.
\end{enumerate}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy}
