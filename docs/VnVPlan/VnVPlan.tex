\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

Researchers at the School of Rehabilitation Sciences (SReS) at McMaster University are interested in performing Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) for victims of spinal disorders and back pain. EMA aims to study the thoughts, experiences, and behaviours of a participant's daily life by repeatedly collecting data in an individual's normal environment, at or close to the time they carry out that behaviour.\\

The type of EMA that the SReS is interested in is focused on analyzing the daily activities and symptoms of mostly-older adults with mobility and spinal issues. They wish to track that participant's walking activity as they go about their daily life, along with prompting participants with questions when relevant events occur. The answers to event-based prompts will be combined with activity monitoring data to form a better picture about the experience this participant has with their spinal and mobility issues.\\

The EMAnator will perform EMA analysis in a manner which even older participants can use, integrated into one package which gathers relevant data about a participant's activities and allows them to easily report what is currently going on and how they feel. They also are looking for a way to access EMA data in various ways. This includes graphical representations of the data which are meaningful to researchers, along with the raw data itself. This data could be activity data, symptoms reporting data, both types of data collated together, and so on. \\

This document is intended to describe the plan for verification and validation of the device. Here, verification and validation are both technical terms with very specific meanings.\\

Verification involves checking whether or not the specifications which were described in the planning phase of the project are implemented correctly by the final system designed. Validation involves checking whether or not the product actually fulfills the needs of the end user of the device. In the words of Barry Boehm, verification asks, "Are we building the product right?" and validation asks, "Are we building the right product?"\cite{pham_1999}.

\newpage

\subsection{Objectives}

The objectives aimed to be accomplished by this verification and validation are to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Validate if user requirements truly represent the goals of the stakeholders of the EMAnator.
  \item Validate if the input provided by the operators of the device meet the established rules and constraints.
  \item Verify if the high-level design of the device correctly fulfills the specifications of the functional and non-functional requirements.
  \item Verify if the components of the device (e.g. source code, database, physical construction, user interface, etc.) fulfill the specifications of the design.
  \item Discover any faults, failures, or malfunctions in the device.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

Since the VnV plan is focused on validating the functionalities of the device through verification of different test cases, the only way to verify this document is to check for all such scenarios and their expected results.\\
\\The following will be done to verify the VnV plan:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item[\ding{111}] Each task will be verified as per \hyperref[4_1]{4.1} throughout the development phase. Verifiers must ensure that tests do not fail at any of the expected scenarios and works as expected from user's point of view.
  \item[\ding{111}] Each section of the SRS will be verified as per \hyperref[SRS_verification]{4.2}. Each variable needs to be controlled accordingly and specific scenarios need to be tested to ensure functionality without errors.
  \item[\ding{111}] Each component of the design must be verified as per \hyperref[sec_4_3]{4.3} as it is being developed, so that unit testing can be performed and evaluated before system testing.
  \item[\ding{111}] Code-review meetings must be attended by all code evaluators. If an evaluator fails to join the review, the review will be rescheduled. Tests will be performed against all possible scenarios to ensure all cases work as intended.
  \item[\ding{111}] All test cases for each functional requirement as per \hyperref[sec_5_1]{5.1} must be verified accordingly by ensuring that the outputs are expected and within bounds, and that variables are being properly controlled and monitored.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The Implementation Verification Plan will utilize static and dynamic code analysis as the debugging methods to find bugs early in development. The checklist below can be used in development to follow the implementation verification plan.\\
The following methods will be used for static code analysis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bi-weekly code review with sub-teams (hardware, software, frontend/backend) for code walk through.
  \item Weekly code review with entire team for system-level software design.
  \item A SAST tool will be used to scan source code, binary and byte code to reveal vulnerabilities.
  \item Static analysis tools such as Pylint and lint described in \ref{Automation} will be used to find bugs in code.
\end{itemize}
Dynamic code testing will help identify exploitable vulnerabilities. The following methods will be used for dynamic code analysis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A DAST tool will be used as a black-box tester. It will input malicious SQL queries, long input strings and invalid data to exploit assumptions made by the developers.
  \item Modular code will  be run separately against a variety of inputs to find bugs in code.
  \item Open source tools will be used based on the programming language (CrossHair for Python, CHAP for C) to provide a comprehensive view of performance and security of the device.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}\label{Automation}

Automated testing and verification tools will be selected based on the different programming languages and tools used in the development of the device. As covered in the development plan \cite{Development_Plan} the following unit testing frameworks, profiling tools and linters will be used for verification of code:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Python:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item unittest will be used as the Unit testing framework for Python to cover test automation, aggregation of tests (integration 							testing) and independence of tests from the reporting framework.
          \item Coverage.py will be used to measure code coverage and to gauge the effectiveness of tests performed.
          \item Pylint will be used as the linter/static code analyser which will check for errors and enforce a coding standard.
        \end{itemize}
  \item C:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item CUnit will be used as a unit testing framework for embedded system development.
          \item Bullseye coverage will be used for C code coverage analysis.
          \item lint will be used as the linter/static code analyser for development in C.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Valgrind will be used for Python (pytest-valgrind) and C as a debugging tool for code profiling.
  \item Orion will be used for SQL/Database testing. It will be used to stress test I/O coverage and to make sure the database functions as expected.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

There will be no plan for Software validation since there is no external data used and all the software-related validations are covered in  section \ref{SRS_verification}.

\section{System Test Description}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}\label{sec_5_1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Duration Test}

The following tests will check whether the device will maintain an "ON" state throughout the duration of the monitoring period. The primary tests will involve different monitoring periods with valid inputs, invalid inputs, past dates, or dates too far into the future beyond what the battery life can sustain (HC2).
		
\begin{enumerate}

	\item{\textbf{DT\_1: Regular Inputs}\\}\label{DT1}
		
		Control: Manual, Dynamic
							
		Initial State: Device waits for the monitoring period to be set up in the configuration of the device.
							
		Input: Monitoring Period ["Date","Time"]  : ["03-11-2022", "05:30:PM"].
		
		Output: Device turns off after monitoring period.
							
		How test will be performed: The test is performed by passing in a valid monitoring period and ensuring that the device maintains power throughout this period.
					
	\item{\textbf{DT\_2: Invalid Inputs}\\}\label{DT2}
	
		Control: Manual, Dynamic
							
		Initial State: Device waits for the monitoring period to be set up in the configuration of the device.

\section{Unit Test Description}
Unit testing is a form of black box testing that examines specific functions of the code and their inputs and outputs. It is concerned about the "what" behaviour of the function as opposed to the behind-the-scene stories of "how" it is implemented.
\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}
Every single one of the functions were inclulded for unit testing, nothing was left out for both hardware and software codes. In most cases, outputs require human interpretation.Thus, instead of using a test code, all programming-related outputs are to be read off of the serial communication monitor whenever applicable. \\

The \href{https://github.com/zakerl/Capstone_Project/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf}{MIS} lists out all the modules and their use, syntax, and semantics.

\subsection{Unit Testing Plan}\label{6.2}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
          successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
          to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
          application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
          computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
          or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
          least one item for each team member.}\\

        Approximately a third of this project's timeline has passed at this point. So far, team members have spent the vast majority of their time generating documentation for this project. In the process of doing so, the team has garnered a good sense of the learning styles, working styles, and habits of each individual team member.\\

        Now that the planning phase has largely passed, now is the right moment to utilize this newfound knowledge about the team to maximum effect. Team \#1 is lucky; each of its team members is deeply committed to achieving excellence in this project. As a result, they are willing to use knowledge about the strengths, weaknesses, and differences of each member in the aim of working as efficiently and effectively as possible. Synergy has become the greatest strength for Team \#1, on top of the large collection of diverse skills held by Team \#1's individual members.\\

        Naturally, identifying the advantages of collaboration in Team \#1 also sheds light on potential blind spots. For this specific team, these blind spots mostly rest within the "soft skills", as team members already are quite proficient with the tools and hard skills necessary to bring this project to fruition.\\

        These soft skills are:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Jessica:} Critical Thinking
          \item \textbf{Oliver:} Engagement During Meetings
          \item \textbf{Jonathan:} Time Management
          \item \textbf{Anish:} Open-mindedness
          \item \textbf{Nish:} Leadership
          \item \textbf{Labeeb:} Communication
        \end{itemize}

        Developing these skills will be essential to the success of the project. It is the responsibility of each individual team member to work on their skills, but it is also necessary for the rest of the team to support them appropriately and make considerations to help fill any holes left behind.

  \item \textit{For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
          question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
          mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
          member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Critical Thinking:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Jessica:} Consider the "why" for each important decision made in the project.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Host design review sessions regularly to look back and determine whether or not the project is headed in the right direction.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Engagement During Meetings:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Oliver:} Chair a third of all meetings going forward.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Assign a portion of every meeting to questions and feedback, without any other tasks preempting this section.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Time Management:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Jonathan:} Set up automated reminders and schedules for capstone related tasks.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Parcel work into sections in which the workload required is easily understood and planned for.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Open-mindedness:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Anish:} Attach equivalent value to conflicting ideas, and weigh objective pros and cons.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Actively promote "devil's advocate" mindsets when making important decisions.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Leadership:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Nish:} Ensure input at least once into every major decision made by the team.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Whenever making an important decision, ask each individual member for their opinion.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Communication:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Labeeb:} Raise every concern that comes to mind. Regardless of size or importance.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Create a section on the Trello board specifically for non-objective related concerns.
                \end{enumerate}
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
