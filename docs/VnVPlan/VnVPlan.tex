\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

Researchers at the School of Rehabilitation Sciences (SReS) at McMaster University are interested in performing Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) for victims of spinal disorders and back pain. EMA aims to study the thoughts, experiences, and behaviours of a participant's daily life by repeatedly collecting data in an individual's normal environment, at or close to the time they carry out that behaviour.\\

The type of EMA that the SReS is interested in is focused on analyzing the daily activities and symptoms of mostly-older adults with mobility and spinal issues. They wish to track that participant's walking activity as they go about their daily life, along with prompting participants with questions when relevant events occur. The answers to event-based prompts will be combined with activity monitoring data to form a better picture about the experience this participant has with their spinal and mobility issues.\\

The [name of device] will perform EMA analysis in a manner which even older participants can use, integrated into one package which gathers relevant data about a participant's activities and allows them to easily report what is currently going on and how they feel. They also are looking for a way to access EMA data in various ways. This includes graphical representations of the data which are meaningful to researchers, along with the raw data itself. This data could be activity data, symptoms reporting data, both types of data collated together, and so on. \\

This document is intended to describe the plan for verification and validation of the device. Here, verification and validation are both technical terms with very specific meanings.\\

Verification involves checking whether or not the specifications which were described in the planning phase of the project are implemented correctly by the final system designed. Validation involves checking whether or not the product actually fulfills the needs of the end user of the device. In the words of Barry Boehm, verification asks, "Are we building the product right?" and validation asks, "Are we building the right product?"\cite{pham_1999}.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objectives aimed to be accomplished by this verification and validation are to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Validate if user requirements truly represent the goals of the stakeholders of [name of device].
  \item Validate if the input provided by the operators of [name of device] meet the established rules and constraints.
  \item Verify if the high-level design of the device correctly fulfills the specifications of the functional and non-functional requirements.
  \item Verify if the components of the device (e.g. source code, database, physical construction, user interface, etc.) fulfill the specifications of the design.
  \item Discover any faults, failures, or malfunctions in the [name of device].
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

Since VNV plan document mostly covers about how to validate our device works, through verification of different test cases. The only way to verify this document is checking all such scenarios and getting expected results.\\
\\The following will be done to verify VnV plan:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item[\ding{111}] Each member has their own verification tasks to verify as per \hyperref[4_1]{4.1} throughout the development phase. They have to ensure the tests don't fail at any of the expected scenarios and works as expected from user's point of view.
  \item[\ding{111}] Each member has to verify the SRS requirements through their assigned tasks which can be found in \hyperref[SRS_verification]{4.2}. The variables need to be controlled accordingly and specific scenarios needed to be tested to ensure functionality without errors.
  \item[\ding{111}] Verify each component of the design in \hyperref[sec_4_3]{4.3} as being developed, so that we can guarantee unit testing is successful before system testing.
  \item[\ding{111}] Ensure that everyone attends the code-review meetings. The member who fails to join the review, a reviewer will be scheduled to review later. Tests against all scenarios to ensure all cases work.
  \item[\ding{111}] All the functional requirements have test cases that can be found in \hyperref[sec_5_1]{5.1}. Verify all the test cases, ensure that the outputs are expected and within bounds. Check during tests, that the variables are being controlled and monitored accordingly.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The Implementation Verification Plan will involve static and dynamic code analysis as the debugging methods to find bugs early in development. The checklist below can be used in development to follow the Implementation verification plan.\\
The following methods will be used for static code analysis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bi-weekly code review with sub-teams (hardware, software, frontend/backend) for code walk through.
  \item Weekly code review with entire team for system-level software design.
  \item Use a SAST tool to scan source code, binary and byte code to reveal vulnerabilities.
  \item Use static analysis tools such as Pylint, lint described in \ref{Automation} to find bugs in code.
\end{itemize}
Dynamic code testing will help identify exploitable vulnerabilities. The following methods will be used for dynamic code analysis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use a DAST tool as a black-box tester which inputs malicious SQL queries, Long input strings and invalid data to exploit assumptions made by developers.
  \item Running modular code separately against variety of inputs to find bugs in code.
  \item Use open source tools based on the programming language (CrossHair for Python, CHAP for C) to provide a comprehensive view of performance and security of the device.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}\label{Automation}

Automated testing and verification tools will be based on the different programming languages and tools used in the development of the device. As covered in the development plan \cite{Development_Plan} the following unit testing frameworks, profiling tools and linters will be used for verification of code:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Python:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item unittest will be used as the Unit testing framework for Python to cover test automation, aggregation of tests (integration 							testing) and independence of tests from the reporting framework.
          \item Coverage.py will be used to measure code coverage and to gauge the effectiveness of tests performed.
          \item Pylint will be used as the linter/static code analyser which will check for errors and enforce a coding standard.
        \end{itemize}
  \item C:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item CUnit will be used as a unit testing framework for embedded system development.
          \item Bullseye coverage will be used for C code coverage analysis.
          \item lint will be used as the linter/static code analyser for development in C.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Valgrind will be used for Python (pytest-valgrind) and C as a debugging tool for code profiling.
  \item SQL/Database testing: Orion will be used to stress test an I/O coverage and to make sure the database functions as expected.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

There will be no plan for Software validation since there is no external data used and all the software-related validation is covered in  section \ref{SRS_verification}.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
          successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
          to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
          application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
          computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
          or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
          least one item for each team member.}\\

        Approximately a third of this project's timeline has passed at this point. So far, team members have spent the vast majority of their time generating documentation for this project. In the process of doing so, the team has garnered a good sense of the learning styles, working styles, and habits of each individual team member.\\

        Now that the planning phase has largely passed, now is the right moment to utilize this newfound knowledge about the team to maximum effect. Team \#1 is lucky; each of its team members is deeply committed to achieving excellence in this project. As a result, they are willing to use knowledge about the strengths, weaknesses, and differences of each member in the aim of working as efficiently and effectively as possible. Synergy has become the greatest strength for Team \#1, on top of the large collection of diverse skills held by Team \#1's individual members.\\

        Naturally, identifying the advantages of collaboration in Team \#1 also sheds light on potential blind spots. For this specific team, these blind spots mostly rest within the "soft skills", as team members already are quite proficient with the tools and hard skills necessary to bring this project to fruition.\\

        These soft skills are:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Jessica:} Critical Thinking
          \item \textbf{Oliver:} Engagement During Meetings
          \item \textbf{Jonathan:} Time Management
          \item \textbf{Anish:} Open-mindedness
          \item \textbf{Nish:} Leadership
          \item \textbf{Labeeb:} Communication
        \end{itemize}

        Developing these skills will be essential to the success of the project. It is the responsibility of each individual team member to work on their skills, but it is also necessary for the rest of the team to support them appropriately and make considerations to help fill any holes left behind.

  \item \textit{For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
          question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
          mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
          member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Critical Thinking:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Jessica:} Consider the "why" for each important decision made in the project.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Host design review sessions regularly to look back and determine whether or not the project is headed in the right direction.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Engagement During Meetings:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Oliver:} Chair a third of all meetings going forward.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Assign a portion of every meeting to questions and feedback, without any other tasks preempting this section.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Time Management:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Jonathan:} Set up automated reminders and schedules for capstone related tasks.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Parcel work into sections in which the workload required is easily understood and planned for.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Open-mindedness:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Anish:} Attach equivalent value to ideas that conflict with your own, and weigh objective pros and cons.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Actively promote "devil's advocate" mindsets when making important decisions.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Leadership:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Nish:} Ensure input at least once into every major decision made by the team.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Whenever making an important decision, ask each individual member for their opinion.
                \end{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Communication:}
                \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \textit{For Labeeb:} Raise every concern that comes to mind. Regardless of size or importance.
                  \item \textit{For the Team:} Create a section on the Trello board specifically for non-objective related concerns.
                \end{enumerate}
