This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
  ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
  something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\subsubsection{Device should be accurate}
The following set of tests will ensure that the device can recognize its state and perform its main functionality in accurate manner.

\paragraph{Accuracy\\}

The following functional requirements test cases are applicable for accuracy:

\begin{itemize}
\item MTT\_1: Regular Movement
\item MTT\_2: Slow Movement
\item PT\_1: Test Prompt
\item PT\_2: Activity Prompt
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Device should be user-frendly}
The following set of tests will ensure that the device is usable by target user population and cause no problems in terms of maintenance and user interactions.		

\paragraph{Usability}

\begin{enumerate}

\item\textbf{{UT\_1: Intuitive UI\\}}

Type: Manual, Static
					
Initial State: The device is turned on and a question prompt is generated on screen.
					
Input/Condition: Testers are asked to answer the questionnaire set without assistance in less than 1 minute.
					
Output/Result: All testers are able to answer their prompt successfully.
					
How test will be performed: A test group of people with age of 40 or older to be asked to receive a powered-on device and asked to respond to a set of 3 questions in 1 minute. These questions will randomly be selected from the following 10 questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Are you a dog person or a cat person?
\item Are you currently inside of a building?
\item Are you currently a student?
\item Did you make your bed this morning?
\item Do you feel tired right now?
\item Do you prefer coffe or tea?
\item Do you have a G driver's license?
\item Do you feel sleepy right now?
\item Which is better: Summer vs Winter
\item Is it daytime right now?
\end{itemize}
					
\item\textbf{{UT\_2: Comfortable Device\\}}

Type: Manual, Static
					
Initial State: The device is turned on and left on idle mode.
					
Input: Testers are asked to wear the device for 24 hours.
					
Output: Testers fill out a survey form regarding the comfort of the deivce on their body.
					
How test will be performed: At the end of their 1 day cycle, testers will be asked to fill out an online form indicating how comfortable they felt the device was regards to weight, shape, stability, etc. The following questions will be asked.

\begin{itemize}
\item Did the device every fall off? If so, please record the following for each case: What you were doing each time? When did the incident happen?
\item How do you feel the weight of the device was? Was it too heavy or too light?
\item How do you feel the texture of the device was? Did you find it uncomfortable in any way?
\end{itemize}

\item\textbf{{UT\_3: Reusability\\}}

Type: Manual, Static
					
Initial State: The device is cleaned using isopropyl alcohol wipes.
					
Input: Testers visually inspect how clean the device is.
					
Output: The device is deemed clean and the device is not harmed.
					
How test will be performed: 1 member of Back End Developers will clean the device and 5 other members will inspect and judge if the device is clean enough to be reused. Amongst the 5 inspecting members, 1 member will then turn on the device to make sure that there was no harm done to the device while cleaning it.

\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection{Device is efficient and competitive}
The following set of questions will ensure that the device is capable of meeting user expectations.

\paragraph{Performance}
\begin{enumerate}
\item\textbf{{PT\_1: Data Transfer Time\\}}

Type: Automatic, dynamic
					
Initial State: The device has collected a complete set of data.
					
Input: The device is connected to the host software and connection is established for data transfer.
					
Output: Data transfer to finish within the specified parameter, TRASFERTIME.
					
How test will be performed: 2 group members of Back End Developers to each perform data trasnfer test 3 times and record the total transfer time for each execution. All 6 tests should result in execution time less than or equal to TRANSFERTIME.

\item\textbf{{PT\_2: Battery Life\\}}

Type: Automatic, Static
					
Initial State: The device is turned on and left on idle mode.
					
Input: Testers wear the device for standard monitoring period.
					
Output: The total amount of time before the device runs out of battery is greater or equal to the parameter, BATTERYLIFE.
					
How test will be performed: 2 group members of Back End Developers each wear the device for standard monitoring period under their normal lives. At the end of each calendar day, they are asked to record their response to a simple question: "Does the device still have battery life left? If so, how much percentage?". 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
  philosophy for test case selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed:

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
