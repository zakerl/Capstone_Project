  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
  ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
  something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\subsubsection{Usability}

\subsubsection{Hardware Saftey Tests}

These tests are designed to test the saftey of the device concerning electircal components and hardware. It is important that the users of our device are kept safe and that any systems in place to protect them from electrical shocks are functioning properly and that our indicator LED functions as expected under certain conditions.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{HST-1: High Voltage\\}

Control: Manual 

Initial State: Device begins in "off" mode.

Input: When device is turned on a voltage over expected voltage is applied.

Output: Device detects high voltage and indicates that voltage is high using indicator LED, breaker or fuse trips or voltage is sent to ground.

Test Case Derivation: N/A

How test will be performed: Use a power supply to over volt the system. 

\item{HST-2: Normal Voltage\\}

Control: Manual

Initial State: Device begins in "off" mode.

Input: When device is turned on a normal voltage is applied.

Output: Device powers on, no issues are detected.

Test Case Derivation:

How test will be performed: Use power supply to provide the expected voltage to the device.

\item{HST-3: Low Voltage\\}

Control: Manual

Initial State: Device begins in "off" mode.

Input: When device is turned on a voltage below the expected amount is applied.

Output: If device powers on, indicator LED indicates that the voltage is lower than expected, device goes into power saving mode

Test Case Derivation:

How test will be performed: Use power supply to provide a lower than expected voltage to the device.

\item{HST-4: Frequency Detection\\}

Control: Manual

Initial State: Device begins in off mode

Input: Device is turned on in normal operating state

Output: Frequency analysis conducted on the circuitry components

Test Case Derivation: N/A

How test will be performed: Using a frequency analysis software such as NI Multisim and an Oscilloscope graphs will be generated for different components of the hardware to determine normal operating frequency compared to industry standards.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reusability Tests}

These tests will test the reusability of various hardware systems of the device. The device should be reusable by multiple participants to prevent electronic waste and reduce cost for the researchers. 

\begin{enumerate}

%add another test or gear test toward charge protection, circuitry to stop overcharging/discharging.

\item{RT-1: Battery Charge/Discharge\\}

Control: Manual.

Initial State: Battery is fully discharged.

Input: Connect battery to the charging cable.

Output: Battery is fully charged without issue.

Test Case Derivation: N/A

How test will be performed: Battery component will be isolated from device and fully charged and discharged 5 times.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Data Security Tests}

These tests are designed to test the security of our system and the accessibility of important medical records. Ensuring that only certain people are able to access these records is a vital part of our design, and ensuring that records cannot be modified is also important for research data integrity. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item{PT-1: Records Safety Test\\}

Control: Manual

Initial State: Device is powered on.

Input: Data transfer cable is plugged in from device to a generic PC, a volunteer tries to access the database and modify the data within.

Output: Database inaccessible and requests administrative security key, volunteer is unable to access or modify the data.

Test Case Derivation: N/A

How test will be performed: Device will be given to a volunteer with technical knowhow who does not have access to the administrator security key, they will attempt to access the database. 


\end{enumerate}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
  philosophy for test case selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
