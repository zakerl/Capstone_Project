The team will also have a Github leader, responsible for managing all technical Github merge requests and approving them. Labeeb Zaker will take on this role.\\

The task of eviewing rubrics, and each subcomponents of the project will not be assigned to any specific member. These tasks are to be allocated to different members each time, to be decided as needed.\\
