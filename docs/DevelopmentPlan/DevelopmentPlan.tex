\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Weekly meetings are to be held every Saturday at 8:00PM, (with an alternative option of having the meeting moved to Thursday at 7:00PM should any difficulties arise in hosting a meeting at the normal time) and additional meetings are to be planned as needed. Any meetings requiring the attendance of the team's supervisor will have to be planned based on Dr. Macedo's availability. In cases where some team members are absent, each absent member is expected to bring forward their discussion topics prior to the scheduled meeting time, and review the meeting notes posted in the Discord server. Note-taker is expected to write down meeting notes for each meeting, regardless of the number of participating members.\\

\end{enumerate}



\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

The risks for the success of the project lie primarily within the software that is designed. The hardware component in which data is collected will be designed with a relatively simplistic plug-and-play approach with the goal of feeding data to the software component of the project. Several off-the-shelf sensors will be used to reduce the development overhead and the many possible problems that developing a complex electromechanic system can involve. However, a proof-of-concept demonstration is still necessary regarding the ergonomics of the project. Should the hardware take on the form of wearable technology (as is currently planned), a demonstration is necessary to show that the system is possible to be worn comfortably, safely, and unintrusively during the user's daily activities.\\

The software system will be the lynchpin of the project. Its goal will be to take the various events detected by the hardware system that are relevant to Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and handle them accordingly. This will involve logging timestamps, locations, environmental factors, and other momentary information, and prompting the user to answer self-survey questions relevant to their current situation. The software system will then process the answers to these questions and the momentary data. Finally it will send off the data to the team of physicians handling the user's EMA at the end of the monitoring period.\\

Other than the ergonomics, if the hardware component of the system is incapable of sending data and handling output from the software, continuing with the project involves finding a new method of data collection and transfer. If the software component of the system is incapable of responding to data inputs from the hardware, processing said data, and returning meaningful results, then the goal of the entire project is rendered moot.\\

The goal for the proof of concept demo will be to demonstrate a functional EMA-enabled software system that can respond to events relevant to EMA, and respond accordingly. This software system will be run locally on a team member's computer. It will be capable of:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Accepting inputs in the form of momentary data from events that are triggered as a simulation of real EMA events (such as limps, falls, strange movement patterns, etc.)
\item Prompting the user to answer relevant self-survey questions.
\item Displaying information and intaking information from the user simplistically according to common HCI guidelines.
\item Processing the inbound EMA and survey data and producing results meaningful to the physicians responsible for the user's EMA.
\item Producing graphical representations of said EMA data.
\item Sending the processed data and representations to the physicians responsible for the user's EMA.
\end{itemize}

Regarding the hardware component of the project, it will be:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Useable/wearable in a safe, comfortable, and non-intrusive manner optimized for human well-being and overall system performance.
\item Placed in a position to collect data relevant to EMA display data regarding EMA related activities.
\end{itemize}

\item Latex will be used for generating documentation. TeX distributions that will be used amongst the collaborators are  Texmaker, TeXworks, MikteX and VScode Latex extension.
\end{itemize}
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI)
\begin{itemize}
\item CI will be used to block merge requests until all tests have been passed and approval has been given by atleast two members of the team. 
\item This will speed up development by reducing the overall bugs introduced into the project.
\end{itemize}
\item Measuring tools for code:
\begin{itemize}

\item Valgrind for efficient memory management.
\item Bullseye coverage for C/C++.
\end{itemize}
\item Libraries to use:
\begin{itemize}
\item OpenCV: Open Source computer vision library capable of performing image and video manipulation.
\item Numpy, pandas: Libraries with Python for number and matrix computation/manipulation.
\item HAL libraries: Should we pursue using an ARM architecture chip, the HAL libraries will allow for ease of coding.
\item PyQt5: Python UI library.
\item Several Arduino Sensor libraries to use for interacting with accelerators and other wireless modules.
\end{itemize}
\item Tools to use for project:
\begin{itemize}
\item 3D printer and slicer tools for rapid prototyping.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations of Tools and Methods of Solving}

\begin{itemize}
\item Python: Memory usage may be inefficient due to limitations of hardware. \\ Solution: Use C or utilize static memory allocation.
\item Arduino IDE: Libraries may be specific to the Arduino Microcontrollers. \\ Solution: Write drivers for other microcontrollers.
\item CI/CD/Code Measuring Tools: Complex to set up, may require extra learning overhead to reach full functionality. \\ Solution: Assign members to investigate and document CI/CD methodology.
\item Libraries: Compatibility of libraries are version dependent and not necessarily backwards or forward compatible. \\ Solution: Run compatibility testing before using or changing libraries and keep updated documentation available.
\item 3D Printing: High time constraints, low availability, and print quality may be inconsistent. \\ Must take time constraints into consideration before integrating 3D Printing into the project.
\end{itemize}

\item Pylint will be used as a linter for code development. This linter can be used as an extension to VS code while developing and debugging code.
\end{itemize}
\item C: lint will be used as a linter when programming in C for development and debugging purposes.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Scheduling}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Master Project Schedule will be made with a list of all the deadlines, deliverables and Project Implementation tasks. Work will be done based on weekly sprints where tasks will be assigned to each member along with an estimated number of days needed to finish the task. This number is evaluated based on relative complexity of each task.\\

\item Imposed deadline for all tasks are \textbf{two} days before the due date of the deliverable. On this day, the team will conduct a review of all the work done by the members and provide any feedback. The last day before the due date is reserved for making any final changes and small revisions. Moreover, the team will check the completed deliverable with the marking rubric.\\

\item Every two weeks, a design overhaul will be conducted wherein the team will go through the previous parts of the project and update it with any changes made as a result of the current iteration of the project.\\
