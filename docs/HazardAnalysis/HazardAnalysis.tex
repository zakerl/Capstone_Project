\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\begin{itemize}
\item All users are fluent in English.
\begin{itemize}
\item The device will not have to handle any other languages.
\end{itemize}
\item No wireless data transfer required.
\begin{itemize}
\item The device operates completely offline, and will not be limited to use in wifi environment.
\end{itemize}
\item All participants will receive verbal instructions prior to using the device.
\begin{itemize}
\item It is assumed that all users will understand how to enter correct response to each question prompt. Any user inputs will be treated as valid response.
\end{itemize}
\item The device is to be used under normal daily activities.
\begin{itemize}
\item The device will not have to be designed for extraneous activities outisde of the scope of EMA.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
