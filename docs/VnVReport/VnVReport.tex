  \item{\textbf{DSQT\_1: Records Safety Test}}\label{DSQT1}

  \textbf{Initial State}: Device is powered on.

  \textbf{Input}: Data transfer cable is plugged in from device to a generic PC, a volunteer tries to access the database and modify the data within.

  \textbf{Expected Results}: Database inaccessible and requests an administrative security key. The volunteer should be unable to access or modify the data.

  Test Case Derivation: N/A

  \textbf{How test was performed}: Device was given to a volunteer with required technical skills who did not have the administrator security key. They attempted to access the database.

  \textbf{Observed Results}: Databases couldn't be accessed and was prompting for a security key, implying the database is safe.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}
Current motion detecting smart watches, such as Apple watches or Samsung Galaxy watches, are desgined for healthy and active population. The EMAnator is specifically geared towards older adults who have chronical back pain. Therefore, it is desgined to capture minor and subtle movements accurately.

\textbf{Last Minute Change to Microcontroller}

A major change to the design was a last minute switch to the ESP32 microcontroller after originally working with the Seeedunio Xiao microcontroller until Revision 0. The decision to switch had to be made for reasons explained below. But, unfortunately this change was only made after significant progress had already been made by the Back End Developers. Going as far as designing and printing a custom PCB with all required hardware and sensors, and integrating the codebase with the Seeeduino Xiao and PCB prior to the Revision 0 demonstration. \\

The Seeedunio Xiao was originally chosen because it runs on a similar ARM based platform compared to the Arduino Nano which was used for testing. This made development easier and provided enough processing power to meet the needs of the design. The Seeduino SAMD21 Cortex M0+ chip has as clock speed of 48 MHz which is 4x faster the clock speed on a typical Arduino Nano of 16 MHz. Additionally, the Seeeduino is a much smaller device than the Nano and could be directly soldered onto the 44mm diameter custom PCB. It would not take up significant space, leaving room for the rest of the sensors and hardware and allowing the design to fit within standard smartwatch dimensions. \\

During development and testing the Seeeduino did not present any issues and development was progressing well. However, leading up to the Revision 0 demo multiple Seeeduinos entered into an irrecoverable state. The reason for why this occurred is still unclear. However, after reading online the Back End Developers speculate two main reasons. First, it is possible that the bootloader region was not properly protected from the factory and it was accidentally overwritten by the software. Second, it is possible that there was not adequate power/surge protection for the Seeeduino since it seemed to fail some time after being connected to an external power supply for sensor testing but did not fail at all during use with a USB cable connected to a computer. \\

After more troubleshooting online it was discovered that this failure is a somewhat well documented issue with no easily available solution. This left the Back End Developers with no choice but to find an alternative microcontroller that did not have a major design flaw and would still meet the needs and constraints of the design. The alternative microcontroller that was chosen was the ESP32. The ESP can also run the Back End Developers code which reduces the total amount of refactoring that needs to be done. However, the pinout and size of the device differs from the Seeeduino meaning that the new custom PCB has to be made larger and the routing updated. The expected fabrication and shipping time will take over 1 week based on prior experience. \\

Due to the size and nature of the problem that was discovered at such a late stage in the project, there is a risk to the completion of the project as a whole. The time to integrate all the sensor code, display code and database code will be very limited once the new PCB arrives. Additionally, there is a risk that the PCB design does not perform the required functionality in the way that was intended. With a lead time of over 1 week if the PCB does not function as required the Back End Developers will have to fall back on a design that focuses on proof of concept rather than a fully fleshed out prototype. The proof of concept design will include functionality of sensing movement, prompting the user, collecting data, and enabling the researcher to view the data as intended by the functional requirements. \\

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:\\	

\textit{In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
        from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
        differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
        these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
        projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
        predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
        evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
        teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)}

-In what ways was it different from the VnV Plan?\\

The process of developing this project from a concept to its current state has been a humbling experience. We (Team \#1: The Back End Developers) believed that we comprehensively covered the timeline of our project in the VnV Plan. \\

-If there were differences, what changes required modification\\
-Why did these changes occur?\\
-Reflect on the quality of the project in general\\
-Reflect on the areas that are yet to be improved\\
-Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future projects?\\

Rubric Goals: The verification and validation data is used to make valid conclusions about the project, in terms of its quality and areas that have been improved and are yet to be improved.  The connection between the data and the conclusions is clear.\\
Rubric Goals: The team reflects on the differences between the VnV plan and the VnV report in the Reflection Appendix.  It is obvious that the team took the exercise seriously and that they have gained an understanding that will help with future VnV planning.\\
