\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

Current motion detecting smart watches, such as Apple watches or Samsung Galaxy watches, are desgined for healthy and active population. The EMAnator is specifically geared towards older adults who have chronical back pain. Therefore, it is desgined to capture minor and subtle movements accurately.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

After testing out each unit of the device system and failing unit test \#2, the type of heartrate sensor has been changed. Below table outlines the rejected heartrate sensor candidates for EMAnator.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
